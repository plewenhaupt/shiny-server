# shiny-server
This is a repository for my Shiny Server project. it consists of a simple Shiny app with different visualizations of statistics pulled from the Swedish Statistics Central Bureau (sounds very soviet-ish...) through API calls to their database. 

The idea is to expand this, making a comprehensive and useful tool for accessing statistics concerning Sweden. 

Coming updates will be the transfer from a Shiny app to a Shiny dashboard, as that format will be more conducive to the overall goal of the project, i.e. to give an overview of the state of Sweden through visualization of statistics.
